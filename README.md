Code for "Context Aware Novelty Detection autoEncoder" by  Ellen Rushe and Brian Mac Namee

**Note for the Mimii Dataset:** The same test data configuration was used as [1]  with all novel sounds being used in the test set along with an equal number of normal segments. This left the remainder of the data to be used for training. A portion of normal examples from the test set was used for validation. Please note that these normal validation examples were also used in the evaluations for all models. This portionâ€™s size was equal to 10% of the number of files in the training data (which are all normal files).
